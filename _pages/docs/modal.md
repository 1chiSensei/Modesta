This will make it so you have a nice popout.
Remember that this also requires JavaScript, which can be found in the **js** folder.
If you need an example, check it in the **example** folder.
```html
<a id="trigger">Click me</a>
<!-- Modal popout screen -->
<div id="modal" class="modal modal--close">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <span class="close">&times;</span>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>This is simple just a test modal for my website :3</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```
